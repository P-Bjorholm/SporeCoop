## Report
Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* The guest's civ AI spawns vehicles for the other nations; the next snapshot kills them
  (`civ(guest)` `removed=` grows by a few per minute). `SpawnVehicle` callers 0xBE7643 / 0xBFBCF7
  use the result without a null check, so blocking needs a hook at the AI decision instead.

## Root cause
See the report (observed vs inferred as marked there).

## Fix
Not fixed yet.
