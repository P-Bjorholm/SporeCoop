## Report
Copied from docs/known-issues.md, where the entry stays up to date:

* `coop_multi.py --fixture creature --players 4 --minutes 6`, seed 1035603402, lanes 1+8, 2026-10-23
  (branch fix/npc-lag): Bob (lane A guest, never rejoined) got a first-chance AV at 0x009ABB5C
  (`test byte [eax],1` after `call 0x9AC1B0`, eax 0xC8124380) 0.1 s after "Carol pings a place",
  then an AV in `GeneralAllocator_FreeInternal`+0xAD 3 s later, and froze in `MallocInternal` (watchdog:
  no frames). Looks like heap corruption from earlier; the bot's last actions on Bob were clicks,
  wheel and `coop.targets`. Not seen in 4 other runs of the same test. Replay with the seed above.

## Root cause
See the report (observed vs inferred as marked there).
