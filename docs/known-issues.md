# Known issues

Bugs found and not fixed yet. Each entry: what happens, how to reproduce it, what is known.
Fixed entries move to the commit message (and a test).

## Guest: rare first-chance fault in a planet render while a world loads

* `exception 0xC0000005 at 0x00FB89D0 cTerrainStateMgr_GetTemperatureScore` (data 0x30, caller
  0xF9E5EC: a planet render gets a null terrain state), guest only, while it loaded a received world
  from the galaxy menu (2 of ~30 switches in `coop_stage_switch.py`, 2026-10-22). The game survives
  it. Not seen in 14 switches since `world.cpp` starts the load outside the frame; if it comes back:
  docs/re/space.md 8.2, and compare with the host (never seen there).

## Tribe: the host froze once while the epic creature was being killed

* `coop_tribe_play.py` on branch feat/net-window, lane 2 (2026-10-22): the host stopped drawing
  during `coop.tribe epic hit` (monitor: FROZE); not reproduced in 14 more runs. The game logs of
  that run were lost (now kept by lab.py). Hunt: `lab.py run tribe_play,chaos_tribe --repeat 10`.

## Tribe: host fault and freeze when a member is added during the game-over caption

* When the player tribe dies out the game shows "Alas! Your population has fallen below the
  minimum needed to survive ... Bounce back in time" and waits for OK (the bounce back reloads the
  last save; with co-op the guest follows, checked 3x in play_tribe work, 2026-10-23). If a member
  is added to the player tribe while that caption is up, pressing OK faults at **0x00C0DAE3**
  (in 0xC0DAD0, a creature method reading `this+0xB54` and the species `this+0xB20`, both null for
  the new member; callers 0xC09CAE in cCreatureAnimal::Create, 0xC0AB99, 0xC0E74D, 0xC1CEAB,
  0xD410F8) and the host stops drawing for good (2 of 2 tries).
* Reproduce (lane N): host kills its own members through the damage path
  (`coop.tribe pincer <own id> <enemy id> 300`, a few times each, until only the knocked-out
  chieftain is left and the caption shows), then `coop.tribe spawn 2`, then `key enter` on the
  host. Without the spawn the bounce back works (frames go on, both machines have the same 3
  members afterwards).
* Only the test command adds members at that moment today; a guest adds mirrors (SpawnMember)
  whenever the host has members it lacks, so a guest that shows its own game-over caption while
  the host already bounced back could hit the same path (not seen: the guest showed no caption in
  4 tries, once it did while the host had none left alive).

## Tribe: knocked-out members stand on the guest

* The game's chieftain (and members of NPC tribes) lie knocked out with 0 health until they
  respawn; the host sends health 0, but `tribe.cpp guest_tick` applies only positive health to
  mirrors (a 0 might start the local death of a mirror), so on the guest they keep their last
  health (e.g. 0.4) and stand. Seen in play_tribe.py (enemy chief `#4 hp=0.0` on the host, `0.4`
  on the guest). The co-op chiefs use the host's health on every machine since 2026-10-23.

## Civilization: the first vehicle snapshot chunk can be too big for a packet (not seen yet)

* The same pattern as the tribe bug fixed on 2026-10-23 (play/tribe): `civ.cpp host_tick` sends
  24 vehicles per chunk (41 bytes each) and the first chunk also carries up to 48 cities (17
  bytes each). A message that does not fit `kMaxPacket` (1200) is dropped by the connection for
  good (`connection.cpp`: "can never fit any packet"), every cycle: with more than ~10 cities
  and 24+ vehicles the guest would lose the first chunk's vehicles (and the city owners) all the
  time. Size the chunks from the byte budget like `tribe.cpp host_tick` does now.

## Test saves: no Civilization save with NPC cities yet

* The `civ` fixture (Agrauel) has only the player's city, so the joint-siege test hits the player
  city with a fake attacker. `new_stage_game.py civ` waits for the galaxy menu now, but the empty
  planet slot it clicks (`--slot 480,290`) is elsewhere on a fresh profile (the galaxy view differs):
  pass `--slot` from a screenshot, then `make_fixture.py` + an entry in tools/tests/fixtures.py.

## Not covered by tests yet

* Tribe: duet and healer bonus in real play (play_tribe.py plays real raids since 2026-10-23:
  pincer, the chief's aura and rescues happen there; the fixture's tribe has no instruments and
  no healer tool, so a social click on another tribe's hut is a food gift, CitizenAction 9, and
  nobody can heal: a fixture of a later tribe save is needed). Civilization: military / religious roles in real battles. Space: raids and
  missions (no live mission in the fixture).
