# Known issues

Bugs found and not fixed yet. Each entry: what happens, how to reproduce it, what is known.
Fixed entries move to the commit message (and a test).

## Guest: rare first-chance fault in a planet render while a world loads

* `exception 0xC0000005 at 0x00FB89D0 cTerrainStateMgr_GetTemperatureScore` (data 0x30, caller
  0xF9E5EC: a planet render gets a null terrain state), guest only, while it loaded a received world
  from the galaxy menu (2 of ~30 switches in `coop_stage_switch.py`, 2026-10-22). The game survives
  it. Not seen in 14 switches since `world.cpp` starts the load outside the frame; if it comes back:
  docs/re/space.md 8.2, and compare with the host (never seen there).
* Guests joining from the galaxy menu still loaded inside the frame until 2026-10-23 (faults at
  0xF9E67E / 0xF9E6FE in the same render pass, a planet without its height map, NPCs 3-9 m off):
  fixed, 0 faults in 7 sessions since. A guard for the null RTTs themselves is being worked on
  separately.

## Creature: one NPC 4 m off on every guest for 30+ s (seen once)

* `out/join_desync.py`-style probe, 4 players, 2026-10-23 (after the menu-load fix): NPC n11 stayed
  4 m from the host's on Bob, Carol and Dave alike from 8 s to the end (36 s); the 19 others < 1 m.
  The same offset on every guest points at the host side or at a spot the proxy cannot stand on
  (pushed out by collision after each stuck-teleport of `drive::step`). Not seen again in 5 min of
  watching nor in 4 more sessions. Hunt: `coop.npc list` on host and guests for that id (err, want).

## Creature chaos: a guest crashed with a corrupted heap (seen once)

* `coop_multi.py --fixture creature --players 4 --minutes 6`, seed 1035603402, lanes 1+8, 2026-10-23
  (branch fix/npc-lag): Bob (lane A guest, never rejoined) got a first-chance AV at 0x009ABB5C
  (`test byte [eax],1` after `call 0x9AC1B0`, eax 0xC8124380) 0.1 s after "Carol pings a place",
  then an AV in `GeneralAllocator_FreeInternal`+0xAD 3 s later, and froze in `MallocInternal` (watchdog:
  no frames). Looks like heap corruption from earlier; the bot's last actions on Bob were clicks,
  wheel and `coop.targets`. Not seen in 4 other runs of the same test. Replay with the seed above.

## Tribe: the host froze once while the epic creature was being killed

* `coop_tribe_play.py` on branch feat/net-window, lane 2 (2026-10-22): the host stopped drawing
  during `coop.tribe epic hit` (monitor: FROZE); not reproduced in 14 more runs. The game logs of
  that run were lost (now kept by lab.py). Hunt: `lab.py run tribe_play,chaos_tribe --repeat 10`.

## coop_civ_play: the guest's "I'm ready" click was lost twice

* Two of seven cold runs of `coop_civ_play.py` on lane 5 (2026-10-23, fixture `civ_npc`) failed at
  "it fires when everybody is ready": the vote stayed at "ready 1/2" although the test clicked the
  guest's visible "I'm ready" button (the lobby had just opened for the vote); a click by hand a few
  seconds later worked. The two failures came while the shared headless display was being
  restarted, the five runs after it passed, so the cause is not settled.

## Creature: a dead NPC's body can lie up to 14 m from the host's for about 40 s

* Seen 2026-10-23 in creature chaos (tools/tests/coop_multi.py, species 06805133 every time): the
  guest's copy dies where the host's died, the host's body then moves (knockback), and the guest's
  body ignores `Teleport` (spatial vt 0x44) and `SetPosition` (vt 0x38) once dead: tried and
  reverted. The gap closes by itself in about 40 s. Cosmetic: eating a body works on either copy.
  `coop.sync` leaves dead NPCs out so the desync check measures the living ones.

## Not covered by tests yet

* Tribe: duet, healer bonus, the chief's aura and rescue in real fights (tests hit through the
  damage function only). Civilization: military / religious roles in real battles, a siege by real
  vehicles of both players (coop_civ_play.py besieges an NPC city of `civ_npc` through the capture
  function). Space: raids and missions (no live mission in the fixture).
