# Known issues

Bugs found and not fixed yet. Each entry: what happens, how to reproduce it, what is known.
Fixed entries move to the commit message (and a test).

## Guest: fault in the tribe setup with a null simulator object (seen once)

* `exception 0xC0000005 at 0x00B12D32` (data 0x2B4) on a guest of a 4-player tribe churn
  (`coop_multi.py`, 2026-10-23): the tribe setup 0xCD78E0, one step after a load, calls 0xB12CE0 on
  `[0x167FAAC]` (getter 0xB3D350), which was null (it is null in the galaxy menu). Not reproduced on
  2 players (`coop_rejoin_loop.py` plain, `--race`, `--reshare`, `--menu`: 0 of about 250 rounds).
  Since 2026-10-23 a load leaves a stage only when it has been playable for 3 s (`world.cpp`
  `kStageSettle`), which should avoid a quit during the setup; if it comes back, the fault log now
  shows the call chain (`exc`: "calls:"). docs/re/space.md 8.3.

## Tribe: the host froze once while the epic creature was being killed

* `coop_tribe_play.py` on branch feat/net-window, lane 2 (2026-10-22): the host stopped drawing
  during `coop.tribe epic hit` (monitor: FROZE); not reproduced in 14 more runs. The game logs of
  that run were lost (now kept by lab.py). Hunt: `lab.py run tribe_play,chaos_tribe --repeat 10`.

## coop_civ_play: the guest's "I'm ready" click was lost twice

* Two of seven cold runs of `coop_civ_play.py` on lane 5 (2026-10-23, fixture `civ_npc`) failed at
  "it fires when everybody is ready": the vote stayed at "ready 1/2" although the test clicked the
  guest's visible "I'm ready" button (the lobby had just opened for the vote); a click by hand a few
  seconds later worked. The two failures came while the shared headless display was being
  restarted, the five runs after it passed, so the cause is not settled.

## Creature: a dead NPC's body can lie up to 14 m from the host's for about 40 s

* Seen 2026-10-23 in creature chaos (tools/tests/coop_multi.py, species 06805133 every time): the
  guest's copy dies where the host's died, the host's body then moves (knockback), and the guest's
  body ignores `Teleport` (spatial vt 0x44) and `SetPosition` (vt 0x38) once dead: tried and
  reverted. The gap closes by itself in about 40 s. Cosmetic: eating a body works on either copy.
  `coop.sync` leaves dead NPCs out so the desync check measures the living ones.

## Not covered by tests yet

* Tribe: duet, healer bonus, the chief's aura and rescue in real fights (tests hit through the
  damage function only). Civilization: military / religious roles in real battles, a siege by real
  vehicles of both players (coop_civ_play.py besieges an NPC city of `civ_npc` through the capture
  function). Space: raids and missions (no live mission in the fixture).
