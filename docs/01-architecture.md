# 1. Architecture and loading into the game

## 1.1 Goals

* The mod is **injected** into the original `SporeApp.exe`; nothing in the exe is patched on disk.
* Game functions are called through a **symbol database** (data), not addresses hardcoded in code:
  supporting another exe version = a new `.sym` file.
* Mods are separate DLLs and can be **reloaded without restarting the game**.
* Everything is controlled and checked from outside (a TCP console), for fast tests and RE.

## 1.2 Layers

```
 SporeApp.exe (MSVC 2008, 32-bit, no RTTI)
   │ imports steam_api.dll (GOG Steam API shim, 3 functions)
   ▼
 steam_api.dll  ← OUR proxy loader (loader/)
   │  • forwards SteamAPI_* to steam_api_orig.dll (the GOG original)
   │  • hooks the exe entry point → loads sporekit.dll after all DLLs are initialized
   ▼
 sporekit.dll  (sporekit/)
   │  • log, config, symbol database (data/symbols/*.sym), address rebasing
   │  • hook engine (MinHook), game lifecycle hooks and D3D9 Present
   │  • main-thread task queue, TCP console (devkit), commands
   │  • mod manager: mods/*.dll, hot reload
   ▼
 mods/coop.dll, mods/<others>.dll   - C ABI (sdk/include/sporekit.h)
```

## 1.3 Why a `steam_api.dll` proxy

Loading options considered:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `steam_api.dll` proxy | the DLL sits in the game folder, Wine loads it first without overrides; the exe imports only 3 functions | GOG-specific (the Disk version doesn't import steam_api) | **chosen** |
| `dinput8.dll` / `winmm.dll` proxy | universal across all versions | Wine needs `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dinput8=n,b` | fallback, same loader code |
| ModAPI Launcher Kit | ecosystem | .NET under Wine, **this exe version is not supported** | no |
| Injection via `CreateRemoteThread` | no files in the game folder | needs its own launcher, startup races | no |

The loader itself is thin: its job is to wait for a safe moment and load
`sporekit.dll`. The safe moment is the **exe entry point** (`AddressOfEntryPoint`): all DLLs
are already initialized, the loader lock is not held, and the game hasn't started running yet. The loader
temporarily replaces the first 5 bytes of the entry point with a `jmp` to its stub; the stub loads SporeKit,
restores the bytes and jumps to the original entry.

## 1.4 Lifecycle

| Event | Source | What mods use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `on_load` | right after the mod's LoadLibrary | registering commands, hooks |
| `on_app_preinit` | hook on `App::cAppSystem::PreInit` (after) | early setup |
| `on_app_init` | hook on `App::cAppSystem::Init` (after) | game managers are created: cheats, messages |
| `on_post_init` | hook on `App::cSporeApp::Init` (after) | everything is ready, main menu |
| `on_frame(dt)` | hook on `IDirect3DDevice9::Present` | all mod game logic, networking, overlay |
| `on_shutdown` | hook on `App::cSporeApp::Shutdown` | save state |
| `on_unload` | before FreeLibrary (hot reload) | remove hooks/objects |

Game objects are accessed **only on the main thread** (in `on_frame` or
in console commands, which SporeKit runs on the main thread).

## 1.5 Symbol database

File `mods/sporekit/symbols/<first 8 hex chars of the exe SHA-256>.sym`:

```
# exe_sha256=922af7c7...
Simulator::cGameNounManager::Get=0x00B3D3D0 ; high m17=0x00B3D400
App::cCheatManager::AddCheat=0x0067FC10 ; high m17=0x0067FC10
```

* On startup SporeKit computes the exe's SHA-256 and picks the file; if there is no file,
  mods that require symbols are disabled (instead of crashing the game).
* Addresses are given for base `0x400000`; under ASLR they are rebased (the exe has `DYNAMIC_BASE` set).
* The `conf` field (high/medium/low/verified) is the confidence level. Functions the mod actually
  calls are checked manually with REA and marked `verified` in
  `data/symbols/overrides_<hash>.sym` (overrides the automatically ported ones).
* A mod declares the symbols it needs as a list; if any required one is missing, the mod reports
  it to the log and console and doesn't enable the corresponding functionality.

## 1.6 File layout in the game

```
SporebinEP1/
  SporeApp.exe              (untouched)
  steam_api.dll             ← our loader
  steam_api_orig.dll        ← GOG original (renamed on install)
  sporekit.dll
  mods/
    sporekit.ini            config (console port, mod list, log)
    sporekit/symbols/*.sym
    coop.dll
    coop.ini
    logs/sporekit.log
    .shadow/                shadow copies of DLLs for hot reload
```

`tools/spore.sh install|uninstall` applies/reverts the steam_api.dll swap (with a backup).

## 1.7 Content (for the future)

Spore picks up every `.package` (DBPF) in `Data/` on its own. If the mod ever needs its own
UI layouts (`.spui`), localization or prop files, they go into a separate package
`Data/SporeCoop.package`; DLL code and content are decoupled.
