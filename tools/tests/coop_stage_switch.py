"""Stage switches in running games (docs/known-issues.md history: loading a Cell save while the
Space stage ran crashed in cStar::GetSolarSystem). The host loads a fixture of another stage with
`coop.load` while the guest stays connected; the guest is then "behind" (another stage than the
host), receives the host's world and loads it in game (world.cpp). After every switch: no faults
in either game, both in the target stage and together (`together 1 1` on the host).

usage: coop_stage_switch.py [--steps space,rejoin,space,cell,...]
  default route: space -> rejoin -> space -> cell -> space -> creature -> space -> tribe -> civ -> cell
  (guest rejoin in Space = space->space for the guest's received world, then host space->space,
  space->cell, cell->space, space->creature, creature->space, space->tribe, tribe->civ, civ->cell)
  "rejoin": the guest leaves and joins again in the current stage, receives the host world and
  loads it in game (seen crashing in the nightly chaos run: Space -> Space)
