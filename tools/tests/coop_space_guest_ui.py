"""A guest who joins while its galaxy menu plays the intro cinematic (GGE_Intro) gets a normal game:
no movie left over in Space (the HUD is there), its real clicks reach the co-op window, and its Space
page works. Before the fix the intro stayed "playing" after the world load: no HUD, every click
eaten by the cinematic's input lock, jumps refused ("a cinematic is playing"); docs/re/space.md 7.9.
